# /etc/default/jackd-rt - override file for contrib/init.d/jackd-rt
# This file provides optional overrides for the init script.
# Do NOT hardcode a username or device here for packages that will be distributed;
# packagers/admins may customize this file if they want system-wide overrides.
 
# Example overrides (uncomment and edit to override auto-detection):
# JACKD_USER="alice"            # user to run jackd as (recommended: a real desktop user, UID>=1000)
# JACKD_DEVICE="hw:0"           # ALSA device to use (e.g. hw:0, hw:CARD=USB)
# JACKD_SR=48000                # sample rate
# JACKD_PERIOD=256              # frames per period
# JACKD_NPERIODS=3              # number of periods
# JACKD_PRIORITY=70             # realtime priority to request
# JACKD_MIDI="seq"              # MIDI driver: "seq" (ALSA sequencer), "raw" (raw MIDI), or "none" (disable MIDI)
# JACKD_ARGS=""                 # any extra args to pass to jackd
# JACK_AUTOCONNECT=0            # 1 to enable autoconnect after jackd starts (uses /usr/local/lib/jack-bridge/jack-autoconnect)
# JACK_AUTOCONNECT_LOOPBACK=0   # 1 to enable mic -> speaker loopback in autoconnect
 
# If left empty, the init script will auto-detect a suitable user and device.
